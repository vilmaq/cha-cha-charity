      "The Way Ahead was originally intended to be a 6-month community art project but 17 years later it is still in demand as a disability art protest piece which clearly demonstrates there is much more to be done, and much more to say. The rules of the road are a wonderful visual system. Information is easily communicated through the arrangement of simple shapes and symbols. When it comes to travel, we have found a system most people can understand easily. The Way Ahead was inspired by a wish that such a system could exist for disability awareness. This exhibition has been co-commissioned with Shape Arts. ",
